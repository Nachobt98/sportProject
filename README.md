# SportLife / sportProject

SportLife is a full-stack JavaScript application for creating, discovering and joining local sports events. The project started as an older React application and is currently being modernized into a cleaner, token-based, quality-gated full-stack project.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React 18, React Router 6, Material UI, Formik and Yup.
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Authentication: JWT sessions with bcrypt password hashing.
- Quality: Jest tests, coverage reporting and SonarCloud analysis through GitHub Actions.

## Current features

- User registration and login.
- JWT-protected frontend routes.
- Session validation with `/api/session`.
- Event list and event search/filter UI.
- Event creation.
- Event detail pages by URL: `/events/:eventId`.
- Join and leave event flows.
- Creator-only event deletion.
- Editable profile page.
- Profile image persistence through the current-user API.
- Created events and joined events panels in the profile.
- Normalized frontend routes.
- SonarCloud workflow with tests, coverage and build validation.

## Frontend routes

### Public

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/login` | Login page. |
| `/register` | Registration page. |

### Protected

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/home` | Main landing page after authentication. |
| `/profile` | Current user profile, profile image and user event panels. |
| `/events` | Event search/list page. |
| `/events/new` | Event creation form. |
| `/events/:eventId` | Event detail page loaded by event ID from the backend. |
| `/faq` | FAQ page. |
| `/contact` | Contact page. |
| `/calendar` | Calendar page. |

## Backend API

All backend routes are mounted under `/api`.

### Health

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | No | Basic health check. |

### Auth

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `POST` | `/api/register` | No | Creates a user and returns a session token. |
| `POST` | `/api/login` | No | Authenticates a user and returns a session token. |
| `GET` | `/api/session` | Yes | Validates the current JWT and returns the current user. |

### Users

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `GET` | `/api/users/me` | Yes | Returns the current user. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/users/me` | Yes | Updates editable profile fields and profile image. |

### Events

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `GET` | `/api/events` | Yes | Lists all events. |
| `POST` | `/api/events` | Yes | Creates a new event. Creator comes from the token. |
| `GET` | `/api/events/:eventId` | Yes | Returns one event by ID. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/events/:eventId` | Yes | Deletes an event. Only the creator can delete it. |
| `POST` | `/api/events/:eventId/join` | Yes | Joins the current user to an event. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/events/:eventId/join` | Yes | Removes the current user from an event. |
| `GET` | `/api/users/me/events` | Yes | Lists events created by the current user. |
| `GET` | `/api/users/me/joined-events` | Yes | Lists events joined by the current user. |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5000` | Backend port. |
| `MONGO_URI` | `mongodb://localhost:27017/sportlife` | MongoDB connection string. |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:3000` | Allowed CORS origin. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `local-dev-secret-change-me` | JWT signing secret. Change outside local development. |
| `PASSWORD_HASH_ROUNDS` | `10` | bcrypt hash cost. |
| `REACT_APP_API_URL` | `http://localhost:5000` | Frontend API base URL. |

## Local development

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start backend

```bash
npm run server
```

### Start frontend

```bash
npm start
```

### Optional dev seed

```bash
npm run seed:dev
```

## Testing and quality

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
```

The SonarCloud workflow runs on pushes to `main` and pull requests. It installs dependencies, runs coverage, builds the project and executes the SonarCloud scan.

## Current architectural notes

The project is in a transitional but increasingly clean state:

- Frontend routes have been normalized and legacy redirects/placeholders have been removed.
- Event details are URL-driven and reload-safe.
- Current-user and event participation flows are token-based instead of username-in-URL based.
- Profile data uses `/api/users/me`.
- Backend code is separated into routes, controllers, services, models and utilities.
- Tests and SonarCloud act as a quality gate for future PRs.

Known cleanup areas:

- Some event relationships still use `userName` strings instead of `ObjectId` references.
- The project is still based on Create React App.
- Event filtering is still performed on the frontend rather than through backend query parameters.

## Suggested next priorities

1. Improve event and user data modelling with `ObjectId` references and timestamps.
2. Add event editing: `PATCH /api/events/:eventId` and creator-only edit UI.
3. Move event filtering/pagination to the backend.
4. Harden auth and security: rate limiting, better validation and production secrets.
5. Improve frontend state/data fetching with clearer hooks or React Query.
6. Improve UX with skeletons, confirmation dialogs and consistent empty states.
7. Add deployment documentation.
8. Consider migrating from Create React App to Vite after domain cleanup.

## PR discipline

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Include tests in the same PR.
- Keep SonarCloud passing before merge.
- Prefer token-based current-user endpoints over user names in URLs.
- Avoid mixing visual redesign, backend refactors and endpoint changes in one PR.
